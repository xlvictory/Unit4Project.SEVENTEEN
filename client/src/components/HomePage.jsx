<h2>About</h2>
<p>Seventeen (Korean: 세븐틴; stylized in all caps or as SVT) is a South Korean boy band formed by Pledis Entertainment. The group consists of thirteen members: S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino. Seventeen has conquered a large audience since its debut and has grown into an internationally recognized K-Pop group with signature music and performances.

The group debuted on May 26, 2015, with the extended play (EP) 17 Carat, which became the longest-charting K-pop album of the year in the US and the only rookie album to appear on Billboard's "10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015" list.Seventeen has released four studio albums, twelve EPs and three reissues.

Seventeen is considered a "self-producing" idol group, with the members involved in songwriting, music production, and choreographing, among other aspects of their music and performances. They perform as one group and are divided into three units—hip-hop, vocal, and performance—each with a different area of specialization. They have been labeled "Performance Kings", "Theater Kids of K-Pop", and "K-Pop Performance Powerhouse'" by various domestic and international media outlets.</p>

<h2>Name</h2>
<p>The name Seventeen is derived from the expression "13 members + 3 units + 1 group", representing how the 13 members are divided into three different units and come together to form one cohesive group. The name originally referred to how 17 members (with the other 4 former pre-debut trainees — Jang Do-yoon, Samuel Kim, Shin Dong-jin, and Yao Mingming) planned to debut.</p>
